/*
Progger

by Devin Gunay

Features to implement:
- Represent chord progressions absolutely and relatively
- Transpose a given chord progression
- Generate a chord progression semirandomly
- Create negative harmony version of given chord prog
- Note frequency calculation (after a tuning is selected)

Other TODO:
- Exception safety stuff (mark functions for if they throw exceptions I guess)
- Pass over all code to check for usage of const and & with params.
