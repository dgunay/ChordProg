### ABOUT

I'm not super sure what the scope of this project is yet, but this is basically intended to be a program that can take chord progressions and reharmonize them. I was inspired to do this after learning about negative harmony from a video of Jacob Collier speaking on the subject, and, finding the idea too hard to perform on the fly, thought it'd be cool if I could just make a computer do the reharmonization for me.

### POSSIBLE FEATURES

#### Planned:

- Change any chord progression into its negative harmony version.
- Make simple substitutions to a given chord progression.
- Transpose chord progressions.

#### Maybe:

- Suggest scales to use for soloing over a certain chord progression.
- Randomly generate pleasant sounding chord progressions.
- Determine the harmony when given a set of notes.
